# Strava Gear Hours

This small utility helps me determine when the suspension shocks on my bike
need servicing based on usage data from [Strava][].

Strava allows you to associate gear (e.g. a bike) with your rides and can
report the total distance they have been used for. However the service
intervals for most shocks are detailed in hours-used rather than distance
travelled.
